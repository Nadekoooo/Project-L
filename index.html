            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Long ago, the realm of Nawamreh thrived under the protection of <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">seven descendants</span>, each embodying a facet of its power: 
                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Paladin</span>, <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Assassin</span>, <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Warrior</span>, 
                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Mage</span>, <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Cleric</span>, <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Archer</span>, 
                and <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Bard</span>. These chosen ones, guided by ancient light, were entrusted with relics that 
                maintained the realm's balance. Each descendant carried a <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">unique legacy and a number—from 1 to 7—marking their role</span> 
                in the grand design of Nawamreh’s fate.
            </p>
            
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                When the calamity struck, <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">Nihil, the devourer of light</span>, rose from the Abyss to fracture the unity of the seven. 
                One by one, they fought valiantly to preserve their realm, leaving behind <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">cryptic numbers</span> and 
                <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">fragments of their essence</span>. These <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">numbers—1 through 7—were not mere marks but keys to a greater truth</span>: 
                a sacred word that would awaken Nawamreh’s ultimate power and banish Nihil for eternity.
            </p>
            
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Now, as the <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">8th descendant</span>, you bear a <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">heavier burden</span>. You are not bound to one role but are called 
                to <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">walk the path of all seven before you</span>. To claim your destiny, you must experience their trials, 
                uncover their stories and seek it Until you Found ALL THE DESCENDANT'S</span> <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">memory that randomly appear in this door.</span></span> It is your destiny to<span class="font-bold text-yellow-300"> recover their final words and see what marks did they leave.</span>. Only by <span class="font-bold text-yellow-300">arranging these words in the proper order</span> 
                can you unlock the power to restore Nawamreh's balance.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Your journey is not one of mere battles—it is a <span>journey to understand the sacrifices of those who came before you</span>,

                The fate of Nawamreh rests on your ability to uncover and assemble the sacred name hidden within their last story written.<span class="font-bold text-yellow-300"> Find the designated word and comeback to this gate and offer it</span></span>.

When whispers of invaders reached her ears, she climbed to the tallest tree, her bow ready, and her quiver filled with enchanted arrows. From her vantage point, she saw shadows creeping along the edges of the sacred grove. With a soft breath, she loosed her first arrow. It flew true, piercing the heart of an intruder and sending a clear warning: Nawamreh was not defenseless." },

As the enemy commander rallied his troops, she drew the string of her bow, whispering a prayer to the spirits of Nawamreh. The arrow shimmered with light as it flew across the battlefield, striking the commander and releasing an explosion of radiant energy that scattered his forces. The forest was safe, at least for now." },

    // Bard stories (19-21)
    { image: 'bard1.jpg', title : "The Song of Awakening", text: "Deep in a forgotten cavern, surrounded by ancient relics, the Bard strummed her lute with trembling fingers. The melodies she played weren’t her own; they were passed down through the echoes of Nawamreh’s history. As the final note resonated, the relics pulsed with energy, their dormant magic coming alive. Light filled the cavern, illuminating carvings of an age long past. She smiled softly—her music had awakened the heart of Nawamreh, restoring hope to a realm on the brink of despair." },
    { image: 'bard2.jpg', title : "The Melody of Battle", text: "On the eve of battle, when morale was at its lowest, the Bard climbed a ridge overlooking the camp. Her voice, steady and unwavering, sang the Hymn of the Unbroken, a melody infused with the strength of Nawamreh itself. Soldiers stirred from their tents, their fears replaced by a fiery determination. As the hymn swelled, a visible wave of energy rippled through the camp, binding the soldiers in unshakable resolve. When the enemy arrived, they were met with a force that fought not for survival but for the soul of their realm." },
    { image: 'bard3.jpg', title : "Echoes of Eternity", text: "Years after the war ended, the Bard’s songs continued to shape the lives of those who heard them. In every corner of Nawamreh, her melodies brought hope to the hopeless, joy to the weary, and unity to the divided. Children learned her ballads, travelers carried her tales, and elders spo<strong>k</strong>e of the day her music turned the tide of destiny. Her legacy became more than her songs; it became the soul of Nawamreh itself, a reminder that even in the dar<strong>k</strong>est times, the voice of hope would never be silenced." }
